<information>Doc 1(Title: Charadriidae) The bird family Charadriidae includes the plovers, dotterels, and lapwings, about 64 to 66 species in all.## Taxonomy.The family Charadriidae was introduced (as Charadriadæ) by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in a guide to the contents of the British Museum published in 1820. Most members of the family are known as "plovers", "lapwings" or "dotterels". These were rather vague terms which were not applied with any great consistency in the past. In general, larger species have often been called "lapwings", smaller species "plovers" or "dotterels" and there are in fact two clear taxonomic sub-groups: most lapwings belong to the subfamily Vanellinae, most plovers and dotterels to Charadriinae.The trend in recent years has been to rationalise the common names of the Charadriidae.

Members of this group can also collectively be referred to as shorebirds.## Taxonomy, systematics and evolution.The order was formerly divided into three suborders: The waders (or "Charadrii"): typical shorebirds, most of which feed by probing in the mud or picking items off the surface in both coastal and freshwater environments.

<information>Doc 1(Title: Cucurbita) in 2014. The following cladogram of "Cucurbita" phylogeny is based upon a 2002 study of mitochondrial DNA by Sanjur and colleagues.## Reproductive biology.All species of "Cucurbita" have 20 pairs of chromosomes. Many North and Central American species are visited by specialist pollinators in the apid tribe Eucerini, especially the genera "Peponapis" and "Xenoglossa", and these squash bees can be crucial to the flowers producing fruit after pollination.When there is more pollen applied to the stigma, more seeds are produced in the fruits and the fruits are larger with greater likelihood of maturation, an effect called xenia. Competitively grown specimens are therefore often hand-pollinated to maximize the number of seeds in the fruit, which increases the fruit size; this pollination
Doc 2(Title: Cucurbita) about the taxonomy of the genus, as the number of accepted species varies from 13 to 30. The five domesticated species are "Cucurbita argyrosperma", "C. ficifolia", "C. maxima", "C. moschata", and "C. pepo". All of these can be treated as winter squash because the full-grown fruits can be stored for months; however, "C. pepo" includes some cultivars that are better used only as summer squash.The fruits of the genus "Cucurbita" are good sources of nutrients, such as vitamin A and vitamin C, among other nutrients according to species. The fruits have many culinary uses including pumpkin pie, biscuits, bread, desserts, puddings, beverages, and soups. Although botanical fruits, "Cucurbita" gourds, such as squash or pumpkin, are typically cooked and eaten as vegetables.##</information>

<information>Doc 1(Title: Common wood pigeon) The common wood pigeon or common woodpigeon (Columba palumbus), also known as simply wood pigeon or woodpigeon, is a large species in the dove and pigeon family (Columbidae), native to the western Palearctic. It belongs to the genus "Columba," which includes closely related species such as the rock dove ("Columba livia"). It has historically been known as the ring dove, and is locally known in southeast England as the "culver"; the latter name has given rise to several areas known for keeping pigeons to be named after it, such as Culver Down.

The presence of names and cultural references is not counted as formal poetics within literary classification.

The image shows a Short-eared owl in flight, which is typically found in open or semi-open habitats such as marshes, wetlands, farmlands, and sometimes even coastal areas. Short-eared owls are primarily found near the coast but their habitat can vary widely depending on the specific population and season. To answer the question about the percentage of the ocean's surface, it's necessary to look at global data on the proportion of the Earth's surface that is covered by ocean.

Below the ocean's surface are the continental shelf, mountains, volcanoes, oceanic trenches, submarine canyons, oceanic plateaus, abyssal plains, and a globe-spanning mid-ocean ridge system.In contrast, Earth's land makes 29.2%, or 148.94 (e6km2) of Earth's surface area. Earth's land consists of many islands around the globe, but mainly of four continental landmasses, which are from largest to smallest: Afroeurasia,America, Antarctica and Australia. These landmasses are further broken down and grouped into the continents. The terrain varies greatly and consists of mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, and other landforms. The elevation of the land surface varies from the low point of -418 (m)
Doc 2(Title: Earth) Earth's surface can be divided into two hemispheres, such as into the Northern and southern hemisphere, or the Western and Eastern HemisphereMost of the surface is made of water, in liquid form or in smaller amounts as ice. 70.8% (361.13 (e6km2)) of the Earth's surface consists of the interconnected ocean, making it Earth's global ocean or "world ocean". This makes Earth, along with its vibrant hydrosphere a water world or ocean world, particularly in Earth's early history when the ocean is thought to have possibly covered Earth completely.

Based on the information provided, 70.8% of the Earth's surface is covered by the ocean.

It is a private residence and has been the home of the Carlisle branch of the Howard family for more than 300 years. Castle Howard is not a fortified structure, but the term "castle" is sometimes used in the name of an English country house that was built on the site of a former castle.The house is familiar to television and film audiences as the fictional "Brideshead", both in Granada Television's 1981 adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's "Brideshead Revisited" and in a two-hour 2008 adaptation for cinema.

Most species are toxic to humans and many other species, primarily due to the presence of cardenolides, although, as with many such plants, there are species that feed upon them (e.g. their leaves) and from them (e.g. their nectar). Most notable are monarch butterflies, who use and require certain milkweeds as host plants for their larvae.The genus contains over 200 species distributed broadly across Africa, North America, and South America. It previously belonged to the family Asclepiadaceae, which is now classified as the subfamily Asclepiadoideae of the dogbane family,

Based on the information provided, Short-eared owls are more commonly found in open habitats like tundra, fields, and marshlands rather than in areas near the ocean. The data suggests that the places where Short-eared owls are found are mainly inland areas. Therefore, the percentage of the surface of their habitat made up of the ocean is expected to be very low. Without specific statistical data on this, a reasonable guess would be close to zero, as they are not known as coastal dwelling birds.

The question pertains to the biological taxonomy of the Nile crocodile and the number of extinct species in its closest upper taxonomic rank. The closest upper taxonomic rank to a species is typically a family or an order. Given that the Nile crocodile is a species of crocodile, it is in the order Crocodylia. However, I need to check if there are any extinct species classified under the family Alligatoridae, which includes crocodiles.

Many genera in Alligatorinae are described, but only the genus "Alligator" is still living, with the remaining genera extinct.## Evolution.Alligators and caimans split in North America during the early Tertiary or late Cretaceous (about 53 million to about 65 million years ago). The Chinese alligator split from the American alligator about 33 million years ago and likely descended from a lineage that crossed the Bering land bridge during the Neogene. The modern American alligator is well represented in the fossil record of the Pleistocene. The alligator's full mitochondrial genome was sequenced in the 1990s. The
Doc 2(Title: American alligator) status of the American alligator is listed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Historically, hunting had decimated their population, and the American alligator was listed as an endangered species by the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Subsequent conservation efforts have allowed their numbers to increase and the species was removed from endangered status in 1987. The species is the official state reptile of three states: Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi.## Taxonomy.The American alligator was first classified by French zoologist François Marie Daudin as "Crocodilus mississipiensis" in 1801. In 1807, Georges Cuvier created the genus "Alligator"; the American alligator and the Chinese alligator are the only extant species in the genus. They are grouped</information>

There are several color variations, but most commonly they are green and look very much like the American green tree frog. They can also be varying shades of yellow or brown, sometimes with white or brown blotching.## Predation.As tadpoles, the squirrel tree frog is preyed upon by dragonfly nymphs, giant water bugs, predatory fish and newts.

It is a diminutive of the Latin "vanus" meaning "winnowing" or "fan".The systematics of "Vanellus" have hitherto resisted clear resolution. Essentially, no major revision can be brought to agree with another, and up to 19 genera were at one time recognized for the 24 lapwing species.

<information>Doc 1(Title: Bird) efforts are underway to protect them. Recreational birdwatching is an important part of the ecotourism industry.## Evolution and classification.The first classification of birds was developed by Francis Willughby and John Ray in their 1676 volume "Ornithologiae".Carl Linnaeus modified that work in 1758 to devise the taxonomic classification system currently in use. Birds are categorised as the biological class Aves in Linnaean taxonomy. Phylogenetic taxonomy places Aves in the clade Theropoda.## Definition.Aves and a sister group, the order Crocodilia, contain the only living representatives of the reptile clade Archosauria. During the late 1990s, Aves was most commonly defined phylogenetically as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of modern birds and "Archaeopteryx

At least one genome has been sequenced from every order. These include at least one species in about 90% of extant avian families (218 out of 236 families recognised by the "Howard and Moore Checklist").Being able to sequence and compare</information>

Doc 2(Title: Columba) widespread throughout medieval Europe. Both the "Life of Columba" and Bede (672/673–735) record Columba's visit to Bridei. Whereas Adomnán just tells us that Columba visited Bridei, Bede relates a later, perhaps Pictish tradition, whereby Columba actually converts the Pictish king. Another early source is a poem in praise of Columba, most probably commissioned by Columba's kinsman, the King of the Uí Néill clan. It was almost certainly written within three or four years of Columba's death and is the earliest vernacular poem in European history. It consists of 25 stanzas of four verses of seven syllables each, called the Amra Coluim Chille.Through the reputation of its venerable founder and its position as a major European centre of learning, Columba's Iona became a place of pilgrimage.</information>

First, the NFL was founded in Canton on September 17, , (at that time it was known as the American Professional Football Association). Second, the now-defunct Canton Bulldogs were a successful pro football team and the NFL's first repeat champion (in 1922 and 1923). Third, the Canton community held a fundraising effort that garnered nearly $400,000 () to get the Hall of Fame</information>

Based on the information provided, the Pro Football Hall of Fame has connections to the Chicago Bears, who have the most inductees with 30, including 36 with partial careers with the team. However, the question specifically asks about the number of teams in the owner of this building, not the number of inductees. Given that the building is the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and considering historical data and the information about the Chicago Bears, we can infer that the Chicago Bears may be the owner or associated with the building.

Based on the information provided, Brassia verrucosa is native to Mexico, Central America, Venezuela, and Brazil. These areas are generally classified under tropical and subtropical climates. According to the Köppen climate classification system, tropical climates are categorized into five main types: A1 (tropical rainforest), A2 (tropical monsoon), A3 (tropical savanna), A4 (tropical steppe), and Aw (tropical savanna climate with wet season). However, the number of major climatic subtypes in these regions is influenced by numerous factors such as elevation, specific plant zones, and local microclimates, which can subdivide the overall tropical zone into more subtypes. However, a general numbers estimate suggests multiple subtypes under the five main tropical categories.

<information>Doc 1(Title: Strawberry poison-dart frog) The strawberry poison frog, strawberry poison-dart frog or blue jeans poison frog ("Oophaga pumilio", formerly "Dendrobates pumilio") is a species of small poison dart frog found in Central America. It is common throughout its range, which extends from eastern central Nicaragua through Costa Rica and northwestern Panama. The species is often found in humid lowlands and premontane forest, but large populations are also found in disturbed areas such as plantations. The strawberry poison frog is perhaps most famous for its widespread variation in coloration, comprising approximately 15–30 color morphs, most of which are presumed to be true-breeding.

A more negative voltage on the grid will repel more of the electrons, so fewer get through to the anode, reducing the anode current. A less negative voltage on the grid will allow more electrons from the cathode to reach the anode, increasing the anode current. Therefore, an input AC signal on the grid of a few volts (or less), even at a very high impedance (since essentially no current flows through the grid) can control a much more powerful anode current, resulting in amplification. When used in its linear region, variation in the grid voltage will cause an approximately proportional variation in the anode current; this ratio is called the transconductance.

The image shows the East Stand of the Boleyn Ground, which is located in London, UK. The Boleyn Ground is historically known for being the home stadium of West Ham United from 1901 to 2016. The question asks about when the building's owner was relaunched. The stadium closure and subsequent redevelopment happened in 2014 from the Boleyn Ground to the London Stadium, but it is unclear from just the image whether this pertains to the ownership of the building itself. We need more specific information about the legal and financial status of the building's ownership to accurately answer the question.

A second referendum followed in 1995, in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent.
